    "1. The data is organized by date, then sorted by decreasing numbers of cases. However, the dates are not sequential, and sorting by a decreasing number of cases is not useful when comparing the impact of covid on different areas over time. The data the chart is telling is that over time the number of covid cases is only going down over time. The reality is that \n",
    "2. I would argue that it isn't okay to misrepresent your data, mostly due to it setting a bad precedent for whatever the data scientist thinks is 'the right thing'. 'the right thing' might even be something good, such as making the world healthier, but it can still be misleading in a bad way. I saw a study a few years ago that stated that specific types of cereal was healthier than 'comperable breakfast options' which were things like bags of chips were the 'comperable breakfast options'."

    "3. I think that if you are getting data online, you are to some measure violating a person's reasonable expectations of privacy. TOS of various apps and even most websites are so convoluted that basically nobody reads them, and most of them hide a clause about data collection of any data you have. I think that the solution should be a law that requires any website that collects data to have a seperate company, or maybe even the government, design a pop-up informing the user of what data is being collected and what it might be used for. Currently, I see that even though some countries require having an option to opt out of data collection, it takes clicking through several menues or having to click on extremely small buttons to opt out, which is clearly not designed for the user.\n",
    "4. I think that what data is being analyzed changes based on the data. If the data is being advertised publically, such as things like current home prices in an area, then it is perfectly fine to scrape the data. If the data is something that might be more hidden, such as a group of people's recent amazon purchases, then it is much less ethical to scrape the data."

    "1. The original graph is misleading because it is 2 charts with different axiis layered on top of each other. The number of cases per population group goes from 15 to 25 on the graph with counties that required masking, but it goes from 4 to 14 on counties that didn't require masking. This makes it look like both charts are initially very similar but then diverge, when if placed on a more accurate chart they would be 2 completely seperated lines.\n",
    "4. I feel like the chart from twitter was much clearer about its message, although you could interpret the new chart also as 'masks reduce instances of covid over time, while not requiring masks keeps instances of covid the same.' This chart is much more honest, but also much easier to misunderstand or misinterpret.\n",
    "5. counties requiring masks have higher instances of covid, but it drops over time. counties that have no mask mandate have fewer cases of covid, but the number of cases remains relatively stable. \n",
    "6. I would argue that counties with high counts of covid-19 would be much more likely to initiate a mask mandate, while counties with smaller amounts of cases would be less likely to initiate a mask mandate. There is also the question of numbers - how many counties are in each group?. There is also questions of political affiliation - rural voters are more conservative, and are thus less likely to enact a mask mandate, but since they are much more spread out they might have much fewer instances of covid in their populations. Also, since each value is a 7 day aggragate of the amount of cases yet the amount is measured daily for a very short period of time, which eliminates some bias but also might lead to changes not being noted. The one conclusion that I would draw about this data is that counties with mask mandates have a dropping amount of covid cases, but nothing noticable. "
